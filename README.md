Whorlwind
=========

A reactive wrapper around Android's fingerprint API that handles encrypting/decrypting sensitive
data using a fingerprint.


Usage
-----

Create an instance of `Whorlwind` by calling:

```java
Whorlwind.create(context, storage, keyAlias)
```

You control where Whorlwind saves your encrypted data by providing a `Storage`. Whorlwind ships with
a `SharedPreferencesStorage` if you want to store your data to shared preferences.

`keyAlias` is used when generating a key pair in the `KeyStore` and should not be shared with any
other key aliases in your project.

All attempts to read/write from Whorlwind must be guarded by a call to `canStoreSecurely()`. This
checks for necessary permissions and whether or not the fingerprint manager is available for use.
The state of these requirements can change over the lifetime of your activity/application so it is
not sufficient to check this once during activity/application creation.

### Writing

Whorlwind handles encrypting the value for you so writing a new value is as simple as passing it to
the `write()` method. However, be aware that Whorlwind will be performing cryptographic operations
and may also perform some disk I/O regardless of your `Storage` implementation, so `write()` should
not be called on the main thread.

```java
if (whorlwind.canStoreSecurely()) {
  Observable.just("value")
      .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
      .subscribe(value -> whorlwind.write("key", ByteString.encodeUtf8(value)));
}
```

### Reading

Whorlwind will handle activating the fingerprint reader and decrypting your data for you once you
subscribe to the stream returned from `read()`. Similar to `write()`, `read()` should not be
subscribed to on the main thread.

```java
if (whorlwind.canStoreSecurely()) {
  whorlwind.read("key")
      .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
      .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
      .subscribe(result -> {
        switch (result.readState) {
            case NEEDS_AUTH:
              // An encrypted value was found, prompt for fingerprint to decrypt.
              // The fingerprint reader is active.
              promptForFingerprint();
              break;
            case UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR:
            case AUTHORIZATION_ERROR:
            case RECOVERABLE_ERROR:
              // Show an error message. One may be provided in result.message.
              // Unless the state is UNRECOVERABLE_ERROR, the fingerprint reader is still
              // active and this stream will continue to emit result updates.
              showFingerprintMessage(result.code, result.message);
              break;
            case READY:
              if (result.value != null) {
                // Value was found and has been decrypted.
                showToast(result.value.utf8());
              } else {
                // No value was found. Fall back to password or fail silently, depending on
                // your use case.
                fingerprintFallback();
              }
              break;
            default:
              throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown state: " + result.readState);
          }
      });
}
```
